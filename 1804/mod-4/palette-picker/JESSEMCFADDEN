## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was not. I initially built out my palettes in a way that made it almost impossible to lock or save. I didn't quite realize this until it was too late. I went throught the process of changing everything to create objects where the colors are arrays within them but was unable to finsh.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?


# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js#L76-L90)

I was able to get my back end working almost immediately and felt good about the implementation. 

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

The pivot to making the palettes an object because of my earlier mistake.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/script.js#L76-L85)

I feel like I struggled with some basic things while making this. Moving to jQuery really made these things simple. I wasn't able to get this working properly.

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

#### Link to Design Inspiration

I used a site called figma to create my wire frame and dribbble for the floating search bar.
